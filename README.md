Many students face significant challenges in efficiently screening job descriptions, analyzing the skills required, comparing with their resumes and updating their it and gain expertise in skills they are lagging behind during the application process. Its a time-consuming process, they have limited guidance and lack of personalization.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to empower students and job seekers by providing them with an AI-driven platform that optimizes their resumes for specific job opportunities. By leveraging advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the project aims to enhance individuals' competitiveness in the job market and increase their chances of securing interviews and job offers. Ultimately, the goal is to streamline the resume optimization process, save users time and effort, and help them achieve their career aspirations.
